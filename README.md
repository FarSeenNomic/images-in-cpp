# Images in C++

Recieved a project for my CMPR120 class, with the simple instructions:

  Create a short, fictional, choose your own adventure story (PG or lower rating) that has at least 4 unique endings and draw a diagram of your story. Each 'page' of your adventure should have at least 2 or 3 sentences. You should have at least 7 'pages' in your story with each page having at least 2 options for the user to choose from.
  IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
  OS: Windows

So I decided to have some fun.
